# LiveDocs

LiveDocs is a project made to allow multiple users to edit rich text files simultaneously.

This is the source code to my project for my final year in Magshimim. For this project I chose the idea, designed a specification, planned sprints, and then implemented it with a mentor and team lead as supervisors. 

This project was developed using the Agile methotodolgy with each sprint being added as in issue on Gitlab and tracked via Gitlab Issue Boards.

Due to time constraints, the project isn't polished and has poor test coverage and has some bugs. This project was also used as a high school dissertation, for which I scored 98/100.
